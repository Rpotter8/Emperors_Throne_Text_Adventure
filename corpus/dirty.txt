1. Enter building. Get keys and lamp.  The lamp appears here should you have to 
be reincarnated.
2. Unlock gate (with key).  Get cage.
3. Try the magic word, XYZZY.  Try it again.  Get rod.
4. Drop rod. Get bird. Get rod.
5. Wave rod. Drop rod. Go get diamonds and gold.
6. Release bird. Drop cage. Grab coins and silver. Note: Dwarves are lousy 
shots, but sometimes, unfortunately, they can get lucky.  Carry the ax, as you 
may encounter up to five of these critters.
7. Try the magic word PLUGH also. Drop silver, gold nugget, diamonds, jewelry, 
and coins. If you haven't already, you will soon encounter a thieving pirate. 
Not to worry, he's got to rob you at least once if you're to win all the 
marbles.
8. Carrying food, ax, bottle of water, key (all for later) and lantern, visit 
the software den (Microsoft Version only). Don't mess with anything--Software 
types are a weird lot.  Get magic word LWPI.  Works only from here.
9. Water plant twice. Get water for the second pass at the waterfall.
10. Attack dragon. Yes. Get rug.
11. Get oil (in now empty bottle). Climb the plant.
12. Oil door. Open door. Drop bottle. While here and while carrying golden eggs, 
enter FEE, FIE, FOE, FOO, one word at a time. Check your inventory.  Go back to 
where you first found the eggs.
13. Throw eggs (to troll).  Cross bridge before the FEE, FIE, whatever.
14. Feed bear.  Unlock chain (with key).  Get golden chain. Drop key.  Get bear.  
Don't forget the rare spices.  At volcano view, read and remember the words of 
fire.
15. Release bear.  Don't try crossing the bridge with him on the chain.
16. Open oyster (with trident).  Pearl will roll down into the cul-de-sac.
17. Insert coin to get a replacement battery for your lamp, if necessary.  Coins 
are a treasure, however, and you won't ge them back, so try beating the game 
with the original batteries only.
18. Never drop vase unless you have already dropped the pillow.
19. Drop everything in order to enter.  Get emerald.
20. Say PLOVER.  Get pyramid.  PLOVER, PLUGH and pi-tooie!
21. You must traverse the maze to get Pirate's Treasure Chest, which doesn't 
appear until he's robbed you.  Return via the Pit and XYZZY.  Drop all treasures 
in the House.
22. Drop magazine in Witt's End for a point.  Get out by entering all different 
directions except north.  It may take a while.  Slog around in various and 
distant locations until a voice announces that the cave is now closed.  At this 
point you are teleported to the two-room Master's Game.
23. Get black rod (with the rusty marks, not the star).  Drop rod in the 
northeast room.  Retreat to the southwest room. Type blast. Alternate endings 
are possible, but will not yield sufficient points to earn you the rank of 
adventure grandmaster.

	Jeweled Fruit		Diamond Ring		Bracelet
	Rubies			Rug			Magic Mirror
	Golden Crown		Royal Honey		Firestone
	Dragon Eggs

**Alternate Reality: The Dungeon**

RSC: IIGS Key to Dungeon Survival

     By now you probably know that certain CDA's, like DSR's "Diversi Hack"  and the built-in "Visit Monitor", permit game interruption, monitor diddling, and program resumption on the IIGS. This opens whole new vistas to SERIOUS gamers, including diskless Realtime Situation Control. With RSC, you can hop into the monitor in mid-combat to juice-up dwindling hitpoints, create food packets for a starving character, shift map coordinates, etc., etc..

     My first 'RSC module' is directed to "Alternate Reality"  mavens enmeshed in the labyrinthine Dungeon. Assuming you have installed either "'Hack" or "Visit '", during play do a CMD-CTRL-ESC, go to the monitor, and enter 800.8FF (RETURN). Here you will find most of your character parms and staple supplies: (All addresses are Hex offsets from $800.)

EXPERIENCE: 3E-40   HITPOINTS current/base: 45,46/47,48   GOLD: B1,B2
SILVER: B3,B4   COPPER: B5,B6   GEMS: B7,B8   JEWELS: B9,BA   FOOD: BB   WATER: BC
TORCHES: BD   CRYSTALS: BE   KEYS: BF  COMPASSES: C0   TIMEPIECES: C1.

The following parms are repeated, single-byte numbers:
STAMINA: 49/4A   CHARISMA: 51/52   STAMINA: 59/5A   INTELLIGENCE: 61/62
WISDOM: 69/6A  SKILL: 71/72.

LOCATION horizontal/vertical/map#: 13/14/15. The game views the 64x64 Level 1 as four 32x32 maps. Coordinates are $00-$1F left-to-right and up to down; maps #0-#3 are NW, NE, SW, SE sections of Level 1. For example, entering 813: 16 03 01 (RETURN) will place you just outside the "Retreat" upon returning to play.

** Cryllan Mission: 2088 (original mission)**

Crusin' on Crylla: 2088

     A good guide to party composition is your standard U.S.S. Enterprise "away team". One doctor can handle all healing chores; a science officer supplies large-area map views (via "Terrain" and "Life Form" scans); and, you need the fire-power of your four weapons specialists.

     Explore the Ruins thoroughly; the Caverns are good for loot and honing combat technique; take care of things in Adion before entering Cramur. Transports are expensive and you cannot take them into mazes; Heavy Armor is a better investment. The best weapons are won from elite enemy guards.

     Finally, two items which should have been included in your mission briefing (i.e. the manual): 1. To enter a transport you've purchased, the first step is to move onto the transport figure and 'click'; 2. Any resurrected team member will have reduced attributes. Don't waste time trying to cure this condition (you can't); after a day or so the attributes will return to normal values.

** Dark Heart of Uukrul**

Become Master of the Game!  (II Alive, 1996)

     When I found Broderbund's Dark Heart of Uukrul for sale at a recent swap meet, it was snapped up without a second thought. Long on my "Must Try" list, the game has proved to be a fine multi-character adventure, playing much like such D&D greats as Champions of Krynn.

     Inevitably, there came a time when it seemed that "'Uukrul" had 'done me wrong'. Expensive armor and weapons were destroyed, rare artifacts were used up, etc. due to what seemed to be inordinately bad luck and/or an unfair lack of information. Then, my party came upon a message etched into a Temple wall: "When all else fails, cheat!" That was the last straw.

     The ultimate "game crack" is to have control of character attributes, items, money, etc.. One tactic is to use a block editor (such as the one included with ProSel)  to search the Save diskette for a character's name and, then, edit on-diskette Game Save info. This did not work with 'Uukrul. The changes were made with no great difficulty but detected by the game as invalid. Evidently, Game Save data is protected via some kind of check sum.

     You can, often, get around such schemes on the GS by doing an OA-CTRL-ESC, going to Visit Monitor, finding the character info stuff in memory, and doing the changes there. (If, after starting System 6, Visit Monitor does not show up as an option, go to the SetStart control panel, click "Enable Programmer CDA's", and reboot.)

    'Uukrul is supposed to be "uncrackable"; so, naturally, it disables interrupts during key accesses. OA-CTRL-ESC is ignored. (Foiled again!)

     Happily, there is more than one way to skin a dragon. If the game shuts down OA-CTRL-ESC access, then, perhaps, we should change the game program! A good start is to search the on-diskette copy of the main program for instances of AD 00 C0, a machine code instruction often used to read the keyboard. There are very few of these in Uukrul; so, it was easy to isolate the main KB input routine.

      On my 5.25" version of the game, I found the routine beginning at byte $110 in block $A5 on the Boot diskette:

2C 00 C0
10 FB
AD 00 C0

     On a copy of the Boot diskette, this became ...

58
AD 00 C0
10 FB
78
EA

     The new routine enables interrupts, waits for a keypress, and, then, disables interrupts. This, essentially, "cracks" the game. The GS user can interrupt the program at practically any moment, do a Visit Monitor, make desired changes, and exit back to the game.

     Although you will need to start System 6 in order to mount the Visit Monitor CDA, 'Uukrul, at least the 5.25" version, does not launch from GS/OS. It is a Pascal-based game which boots from its own diskette. This is nice because it means that you will not need to hunt for the program in GS memory. It will reside in memory Bank $00.

     In 'Uukrul, you find the party's Food, as a two-byte hexadecimal value, at address $976E.  As usual, the low byte is first; so, for example, 5E 01 means you have $15E, or, in decimal, 350 Food packets. (By the way, a cheapo Radio Shack calculator which does hex-to-decimal conversions is very handy for this kind of work!)  The Party's Money is saved as decimal, lower bytes first, starting at address $9770.

     If, while in the monitor in 80-column mode, you enter 97E0.98EF (RETURN), you will see that character names show up in the right side of the display. As in most such adventures, 'Uukrul stores data for individual characters beginning with Name followed soon by Experience (in decimal)  and values of attributes, like Dexterity, Piety, ...,  in hexadecimal. To make it easier to see what's where, it's a good idea to jot down attributes, hit points, spell points, experience, etc. before going to Visit Monitor.

     Toward the end of a character's entry are his/her possessions (weapons, armor, healing salve, etc.)  stored as two-byte codes. For instance, if a magic user is wearing Silken Robes, you will find 02 55. A charged-up Wand of Potency is 58 D0 and one which is worn out is 58 D8. (To recharge any charged item, you just change the final "8" to "0".)  Figuring out what code goes with which item is fun and, as you can see, very useful!

     The best time to interrupt most adventures is during some non-special situation, such as while your party is exploring a maze. Once the mods (e.g. more Money, more Food, etc.)  are done, you return to the game.

     Your changes may not, immediately, be reflected in the display. No problem. Walking around a bit, battling some monsters, or visiting a shop will usually force a display update. (This also lets the program reinit pointers and other values which may have been affected.)  Once it's clear that your mods have taken affect, do a Save.

     When making changes, a good 'rule of thumb' is to avoid extremes. For example, if you need food, give yourself 400-500 packets, not 65535! Few D&D style adventures allow attribute values much above 18 (12 in hex); setting Strength to something like 127 ($7F) could bomb the program.

     If increasing a character's Experience, it is best to set a value just below the point at which the next Level increase occurs. Otherwise, your higher Level may be recognized; but, you may get none of the Hit Point, Attribute, etc. boosts which go with advancement!

    Similarly, when you decide to add some item to a character's inventory, do it by overwriting some other, roughly similar item. For instance, add a Healing Potion by replacing, say, a Flask of Poison, not a 75 lb Mace! This reduces the chance of problems in games which maintain a separate item count for each character or keep track of total weight of items carried.

     Perhaps most important, you do not want to spoil the game's challenge. Giving your party enough money to replace a valuable suit of Elfin Chain Mail destroyed by a lucky hit from an Acid Lizard may make sense; but, awarding your party 100,000 gold would ruin the value of many rewards supplied by the game for completing difficult quests. The same principle applies to Hit Points, Spell Points, etc..

     In fact, 'breaking into' any game produces a new challenge: win with the minimum use of the powers at your disposal. Others, lacking such arcane knowledge, are free of this dilemma. Alas, it is a burden you must bear once becoming Master of the Game!

** Deathlord **

Becoming a Deathlord Survivor

     Possibly, you are enmeshed in "Deathlord" (or, eventually, will be) and are perplexed by 'hero die-off'. (Even Gorbash, winner of Ultima's IV and V, M&M I and II, etc., put "Deathlord" on the back burner for a few months.)  One solution, as usual, is 'super-natural intervention'-- i.e. you diddle a few character parms and, SHAZAM!, your guys suddenly feel stronger, faster, smarter, and richer! A second trick is to minimize the damage should a 'worst case scenario' eventuate.


[The "SHAZAM" approach is to edit character attributes. When you do this, it's a good idea to have a list of each character's current Hit Points, Strength, etc.. This makes it easier to check which attribute is being changed (and whose) when doing the editing.

It is a good idea to make backups before editing. If playing on an emulator, you can use the Windows Copy option to put a duplicate of your DSK's in another folder.

If you've been playing on an emulator or using a 'deprotected' copy of the game, the DSK's or diskettes may be 'open'-- at least open enough so that the patch described in steps 1-3 should be skipped. Try starting Copy II Plus's Sector Editor, inserting the Scenario A disk, and going to step 4. If Sector Editor can not read the sector mentioned, you will probably need to do steps 1-3.]


     First, the SHAZAM solution: Using Central Point's "Copy II Plus" ($39.95, for 128K Apple) and DOS alteration data found in Rob Fiduccia's "Deathlord" article in issue #63, we scanned the Scenario A diskette and found character data in sector $0D on track $13. (1. Go to 5.25" Bit Copy.  2. In the Sector Editor enter "P" to get to the DOS patcher and then "Custom".  3. Under "Address", change D5 AA 96 to D5 AA D6 and DE AA to DE B7. Under "Data", change D5 AA AD to D5 AE AD and DE AA ... to EA AA ... . 4. Exit the patcher and Read T/S $13/$0D. NOTE: Should you wish to scan the diskette starting at track $0, expect to encounter a few unreadable sectors along the way. Just skip these and continue.)


[Character attributes in games are usually coded as hexadecimal values. For example, if the first character in your party has a Strength of 17, you would expect to find 11 ($11 = decimal 17) at byte $72 of the sector when viewed with the Copy II Plus Sector Editor.

For a two-byte value, like 270 Hit Points (max) for the first character, the hex value is $10E and you would expect to find 0E at byte $42 and $01 at byte $48.]
  

     On the Sector Editor screen, you should find character data arranged in six-byte groups (one byte per character) starting at the following bytes:

$42: Hit Points, max (low byte)
$48: Hit Points, max (high byte)
$4E: Hit Points, current (low byte)
$54: Hit Points, current (high byte)

$66: Level                           $72: Strength
$78: Constitution                    $7E: Size
$84: Intelligence                    $8A: Dexterity
$90: Charisma                        $96: Power, current
$9C: Power, max                      $CC: Age
$D2: Food                            $D8: Gold (low byte)
$DE: Gold (high byte).

Edit as desired, write your SHAZAMed characters back to disk, and your quest against the Deathlord is a 'whole new ball game'.


     Granted, if you max-out every parm and give each character $10,000 gold, there isn't much your party can't handle. If, however, you merely go for a "fair start", then the inconvenience associated with having several characters wiped out remains a threat.

     You can make a character backup each time you start the game; but, of course, you won't. It's too much bother, the backup won't restore hours of progress made in the current session, and, besides, there's a better way!

     Use the "Make Scenario" function to create a copy of each current scenario diskette on its unused side. During play, you just do an occasional SAVE on alternate sides. If your party is wiped out and saved as dead on Side One, you can restart from Side Two, etc.. Whatever happens, you will never lose more than the progress made since the last opposite-side SAVE.

** Defender of the Crown **

Defending the Crown

     In Cinemaware's new adventure/wargame, "Defender of the Crown", crunching the opposition takes a lot of practice. You can take it on the chin for however many sessions it takes to 'learn the ropes'; OR you can employ a touch of Realtime Situation Control to make those 'practice games' into victories!

     As usual, the "Visit Monitor" CDA (or some equivalent) must be installed before booting the game. During play, enter CMD-CTRL-ESC to call up the CDA menu, select "Visit Monitor", and enter 03/BC00.BC2F (RETURN) to view the main status bytes for you and your five rivals (arranged in six-byte sets). Whether "Wolfric the Wild" or some other Saxon, your parms are always first in each set: INCOME ($03/BC03), LEADERSHIP ($03/BC0F), JOUSTING ($03/BC15), SWORD FIGHTING ($03/BC0B), and TREASURY ($03/BC2D).

     For long play, with plenty of opportunity to practice jousting, sieges, and sword fighting, all you really need is a big army. This you obtain by juicing-up your treasury (e.g. $03/BC2D: F0). Of course, you will certainly want to try your hand at raids and fair maiden rescues(!); so, just boost your sword fighting skill (e.g. $03/BC0B: 1F). Thusly imbued with truth, justice, and raw power, you are ready to hone your technique AND to guarantee that the Crown of England doesn't fall into the wrong hands!

** Dragon Wars **

Dragon Wars Survivors

     How many new guys have YOU lost in Interplay's "Dragon Wars"? Well, that's too many! Before you send in another bunch of doomed weakies, (if you are playing on a IIgs) send your characters through the Computist Enhanced Experience Environment (i.e. the "C3E").

C3E Directions:

Install a monitor entry CDA (e.g. "Diversi Hack") in the Desktop and boot the game. Once you have four characters, do an OpenApple-CTRL-ESC to get to the Desktop; and enter the monitor.

Character data blocks begin at $4000, $4200, $4400, and $4600. Just enter $7F at byte $3B in each block (e.g. $403B: 7F, $423B: 7F, etc.).

Return to the game and go to the Experience displays. Now, instead of only 50 points to spend on each character's attributes and displays, you will have 127!



    &&&&& Purgatory Lore Flyer (FREE! Please Take One) &&&&&

On a map of Purgatory (with X-Y coordinates of 0-31, 0-31), you begin at 19,12. Purgatory has five "towers" and is surrounded by two walls (with a passage between the walls).

Visit the small shop along the NW wall to acquire Low Magic scrolls.

Volunteers hang out at a bar in the NE.

Black marketeers sell weapons and armor in a North wall shop.

When you need a Magic Power recharge, check out a pool in the South Tower.

Don't overlook hidden doors in some of the other towers.

If you reach the gap in the SE outer wall, USE your Swim skill to get out.


Tavern Tales

"... still packs the Slicer he found in the Underworld and Wackee favors her Dragon Sword. Still when y' want a good solid hit and a few extra yards o' reach, it's hard to beat this here Dragon Tooth."

"Our archer wasn't worth spit 'til we found that cache of Grey Arrows in the guard house near the bridge. 'Course, the guards made a terr'ble fuss; but now we can jus' walze in there any old time, spring the lock, and... some other nice stuff in the same chest... "

"... to use the Spectacles again and scarf up on more goodies? Right? But it didn't work. You get to the last room and the door is missing! Then Rubywand says, 'Look, we've sprung Zaton; so, let's ditch the Bowl and give it another try.'..."

"... place has been sinking for years. Well, Doc Gorbash takes one look and says: 'Hydraulics, Gentlemen, is hydraulics. There has to be a mud leak somewhere. ...'"

"... we're about to say adios to the Underworld and try out Lansk hospitality, when Mothnose spots this weird pool just a stone's throw to the west... "

"So this mean mud sucker is sittin' there waitin' to be fed and I'm startin' to think maybe we're on the menu. Then ol' Batfoot here blurts out: 'The Mystic Woods! I've still got those... "

"... claims they tinkered up a mean little beauty called the Dragon Horn; and it's still down there. Trouble is, no one knows what happened to the dwarves."

**Elite**

An ELITE Craft (ref. Computist #70)

     Okay, gaining Elite combateer status and finding the mysterious planet Raxxla isn't supposed to be easy. (That's why they call the game "Elite".)  On the other hand, anything which can make your quest a bit less difficult is worth serious consideration. The Thargoid invaders certainly don't hesitate to implement every advantage their bug brains can contrive; why should YOU settle for less than the best in human technology?!

     Every combateer is well acquainted with the Mk III Cobra's major limitation: in galaxies where planetary distances can exceed 100 light years, your fighter/trader craft carries only about seven light years worth of hyperspace jump fuel. Nearly as bothersome, the standard Xexor/Hikan Ltd. intergalactic hyperdrive is good for only one hop; whereupon you must locate a new supplier AND shell out another 5000 credits! Happily, thanks to advanced research at Computist Corp.'s Turdnil Labs, BOTH of the above barriers have been shattered!!!


Specifications

CC/TL Super Jump: exclusive Tardis-pack for 25.5 LY range on standard fuel
CC/TL Multi-Galactic: new Dura-Wolfram core for unlimited repeat G-hops


Installation and Operation

     To implement the new designs, you must be able to RESET or NMI into the Apple monitor while "Elite" is running. For the many readers who have added special "$F8xx " PROMS or are using an OLD, pre-autostart, Apple II, this should be no problem. (Our II+ is equipped with home-brew firmware to allow forcing a "RESET into monitor". Unfortunately, "Elite"'s combat displays do not work correctly on the IIgs; and, besides, the OA-CTRL-ESC interrupt is defeated.)  The best time to break in is when docked and viewing one of the game's text displays.

     For Super Jump enter the following at $6F0C: A2 FF. This mod increases fuel top-off level (i.e. you can buy more). It does not affect fuel received should you use your Escape Pod or the amount which can be 'sun-skimmed'.

     To have access to multi-galactic jump capability, you must own a "Galactic Hyperspace" drive. (If you do not own one, installing the MG mod will allow multi-jumping as soon as you do.)  Enter $6BAE: A2 FF 8E BC 02 E8 EA EA EA 8E C3 02. The new code makes sure that, when you do a "G" hop, your inter-galactic drive is restored and legal status resets to "Clean".

     Once the enhancements are in place, entering $6E87G restarts the program. You will be docked at the current system's trading station. First, buy some fuel. Your status display will show "Fuel: 25.5 light years"! Switch to the Galaxy Display (i.e. "5" key) to see your new 'range circle'. (WOW!)  To try out Multi-Jump, blast off and do a "G". Zavoom! You're in the next galaxy; AND you still have a Galactic Hyperspace drive ready for another hop! To be sure, a very challenging quest remains; but, now, you are at the helm of a Cobra Mk III PLUS!


Elite Craft Tech Note (ref. Computist #76)

Turdnil Labs Maintenance Note EC/DE25.5/11.90/Elt. 

     Evidently,  as Bob Igo indicated last month, there ARE different versions of the game. I worked from an original supplied by Firebird at the time Elite was first released. All of the mods described in issue #70 were incorporated into an open copy of the original-- created to avoid having to make the changes upon each boot-- and they all work fine. That the code locations would be off by just one (e.g. $6F0C vs. $6F0D) in some versions is odd, but not unheard-of. Bob also notes that his fuel boost involved an LDY (i.e. $6F0D: A0 FF) instead of the LDX.

     Recommendations: After RESETing into the monitor, check the code in the areas to be changed. If you find $6F0C: A2 46, then the issue #70 stuff (as corrected in the above maintenance note) should perform as advertised. If you find A0 46, (A2 46, etc.) at a slightly offset location just change the $46 to $FF. The same holds for changes to $6BAE: AE BC 02 ... AND to program restart ("$6E87 G"). Instead of $6E87: A9 20, you may find $6E88: A9 20.

     As to completing the Navy's first mission: just follow directions. Two things may throw you off the scent of the rogue craft. First, you may not find clues at every station along the way, especially after a Galactic jump. (I picked up the trail in G2 at Errius.)  Second, wait a couple seconds after docking before you start punching keys; otherwise, some messages may be cut off. It's also a good idea to check the current planet's description upon docking.

     How to become Elite? There may be some shortcut; but, as far as I can tell, you become Elite by blowing away many MANY enemy ships.

**Generic 'Red Sheet' fix**

Getting the Red Out

     Granted, a software vendor has the right to protect its products any way it sees fit; and, when it employs documentation (instead of screwing-up the software), it deserves a pat on the nose. The dark red code sheets technique employed by some vendors comes close to being an exception. It's nice that they are machine-uncopiable (though, naturally, anyone determined to steal the product need only invest an hour or so to make a copiable hand copy). It's too bad that, under normal lighting, the codes are nearly invisible.

     After missing the correct response twice on a newly arrived game employing tiny print on such a red background, I was carping about "protection that spoils player enjoyment ...", when Gorbash turned from a nearby computer and suggested: "Maybe you could bleach it out."  Well, when an M.I.T. chemistry Doctor of Science says "try bleach", you try bleach. Viola! A dip in a tray of Purex plus some drying/flattening between paper towels in an old magazine and the job is done. (Warning: bleach is bad stuff; so, be careful.)  The red is gone and blue print stands out clearly on a light-yellow background. Magic!

** Keef the Thief **

Keef 'Visits' YOCS

     Boy was that close! Ye Olde Computists' Scroll Shoppe must have more traps than the Tel Mercon treasury. Now, to see if it was worth the trouble ...

The first scroll reads "After what she says, this may sound dippy: to please the Princess, think like a hippy!

The second scroll says "North, South, or West, Mem Santi Maze drives you mad, at best. To find Mem's First, young man, go East. That way there's a chance at least." (Gosh, what really excellent poetry!)


Your last prize isn't a scroll at all, just a rolled-up yellow legal pad sheet with some crude notes: "You always see an orange flash when you walk into a wall, right? Uh uh, not if the wall conceals a secret door!" and "Talk to the Smith in TM to find out about guards and bridges." and "Check out Al Handratta's hut near the sea in the southeast."

** Might & Magic II **

M&M II Finale

     From Gorbash, Goo-Goo, Igmo, ... (i.e. my dad) comes a pair of hints that could save your "Might and Magic II" party a bunch of grief as you near ultimate victory:

1. The last puzzle requires you to translate an eight-letter word into its coded version using a famous document excerpt (in code) as your guide. So, if the word is "Freedoms" (it isn't), you might reasonably win with something like "XJKKAHLV", right? No way! "Xjkkahlv" is a better try. (Preserve the case or face disgrace!)

2. If you've been playing on a speeded IIe or IIgs set to FAST, then beware. The last puzzle is timed via a program software loop. At FAST, the ten minutes normally allowed shrinks to about four! Before booting the game for the 'big push' (i.e. you know the password and are ready to tackle The Island), setting speed to NORMAL could make all the difference.

** Miscellaneous SSI AD&D Buglets **

     Lest a new player be concerned that "Something is wrong with my computer", it is worth noting that, indeed, some of SSI's AD&D games do exhibit a few glitches. You do not, for example, always get a "Keep" option when selling gems and jewelry; and, "Sell" sometimes switches to "Join". Occasionally, your inputs for Platinum to be Traded are ignored; a few non-critical artifacts don't work as advertised; early adventures failed to warn that elves cannot be resurrected; etc.. To these you can add the absence of a map for Level 3 of the Mines in the 'Silver Blades Clue Book (Level 1 is repeated)-- all in all, fairly minor stuff which is 'nice to know about', but does not seriously impact enjoyment. ("Easy for you to say; none of YOUR characters is an elf!" True.)

     Returning to 'Silver Blades: there is at least one piece of documentation which approaches bug-by-omission status. You may "Join" (combine) spell scrolls into 10-scroll bundles. This can easily put 20-30 major attack spells at the ready disposal of each magic user-- a factor which drastically affects game strategy. Yet, the feature is mentioned only as a brief note on the last fold of the "Data Card".

     A more serious bug turned up in Champions of Krynn. Here the protection scheme uses references to passages in the "'Journal", instead of an 'Infotator'-type code wheel. The problem is that, perhaps once in every ten game starts, you will be asked to type in "Word #116 of Journal entry #207", etc.. Well, aside from the ridiculous requirement of counting 116 words, there is no Journal entry #207!

     With a little experimentation (you get three tries at the right answer), my dad and I came up with two words that seem to work most of the time: KNOW and HELP. (You may need to reboot once or twice to get a protection check which will accept one of these words.)  Altogether (i.e. over the life of the game), the bug probably cost me no more than four or five reboots.

** Pool of Radiance **

No Clue in the Pool?

     Responding to various rumors, SSI's Linda Blanchard notes that there is currently no plan to supply free Clue Books with any of the TSR D&D adventures.

     Regarding David Stewart's observation that Pool of Radiance left him wandering and victoryless: Yes, due largely to the piecemeal nature of the quest (i.e. you are supposed to clear the city of Evil), POR is known for its unspectacular ending. So long as you do not expect any fireworks, you will have a pretty good idea when to declare Victory in POR.  (Besides, the adventure continues in a sequal!)

     As to being able to wander around after winning: this is an on-purpose feature of TSR adventures. Characters on the verge of Level promotion can gain experience and advance in preparation for the next adventure.



Pool Cues

     For those currently enmeshed in Pool of Radiance here are a few doplets of information which may prove useful.


I. The Bishop's Volunteer

     At some point you will visit Bishop Braccio (near the temple just east of City Hall). He will offer the services of a Level 6 cleric named Dirten who will join your party to help clean out the Temple of Bane.

     Needless to say, Dirten is a valuable addition, particularly since his Lawful Good alignment means that he won't turn tail or backstab your characters in the heat of battle. Unfortunately, if he is in on the Temple of Bane mission, he will (according to the Clue Book) leave your party once the job is done.

     I happened to visit the Bishop AFTER clearing Bane's temple of evil doers and gromming the treasures (I had not, however, destroyed the alter); yet old Braccio made the same offer! Since there was a vacant character slot, I accepted and discovered that Dirten is perfectly willing to stick with the party to the end.



II. New Alignments for Old

     Evidently, the fighter NPC's (non-player characters) you can hire at the Dueling Hall always come with a Lawful Evil alignment. To make this "Chaotic Good", change byte $D8 in the character's descriptor block from $02 to $06. ($00 for Lawful Good, etc.. The values follow the same order as the "Alignments" listing on page 5 of the game manual.)  If playing on a IIe, you can modify on-diskette character data (see T. Rapheld's article in Issue #70).

     On a IIgs, the easiest approach is to make changes directly to memory during play. Just install the Visit Monitor CDA (Call -151 and enter #) before booting. (Or, you can boot a diskette which installs DSR's Diversi Hack.)

     Once the game is running and you are walking around town, do an OpenApple-CTRL-ESC and select "Visit Monitor" from the Control Panel. Find the block for your NPC (e.g. "Hero") which should begin somewhere between $4400 and $4F00 and enter the new alignment (e.g. $4AD8:06).

     This is also a good time to give your NPC a real name (e.g. replace "HERO" $4A00:48 45 52 4F 00 ... with $4A00:4D 4F 54 48 4E 4F 53 45 00 ... for "MOTHNOSE", etc.). CTRL-Y returns you to the Control Panel where selecting "Quit" puts you back in the game.

Note: Whenever modifying characters as above, be sure the target character is not currently selected (e.g. being VIEWed, etc.) when you go to the control panel. The program maintains a status buffer for a VIEWed character which, once you return to the game, may over-write any changes. Hence, the suggestion that you interrupt play while in 'Exploration mode' (movement using I, J, K, M keys).


III. Super Weapon?

     Somewhere along the way, perhaps during the mission to clear the Valhingen Graveyard, I came upon a "+2 Two-handed Sword". The item went unnoticed until the usual post-mission visit to the Armor Shop, where a "Sell" check produced an offer of 20,000+ gold! THEN I observed that the "+2" did not, as usual, follow the item name.

     Tests indicate that it is not a sword or even a weapon. It is a magical artifact which grants a brief enormous increase (when you USE it) in the wielder's hitpower-- perfect for the big showdown with The Boss. (Unfortunately, my experiments wasted the phantom sword's power. You, however, can be on the look-out for the item and put it to better use.)


IV. Endgame

     Finally, you are dispatched (on a special mission from a councilman) to help the Forces of Good seize the Stowjanow Gates. After this success, you will be able to enter Valjevo Castle, wend and/or hack your way through a hedge maze, and take on The Boss in his two-story keep at the center. (See pictorial map on page 26 of the "'Journal".)


Strategy Hints

In the first part of the 'Final Battle', feel free to unload all of your mass-destruction spells on the elite guards. (They aren't much good against The Boss anyway.)

If you survive this fight, you'll have a chance to pick over some +3 Rings of Protection, heavy-duty Plate Armor, and at least one +5 Long Sword. Be sure to try the new stuff here (i.e. TAKE and then VIEW/READY items while checking changes in Armor Class and Damage).

Immediately after EXITing the TAKE routines, you will, at last, see the Pool of Radiance and face The Boss himself. One or two fighters armed with Fine (silver) Longbows and silver arrows are VERY helpful here. (You will have to be a fast reader to catch all of the message following victory. ALTERing speed to its slowest setting before the battles may be a good idea.)


     As noted earlier, adventure players accustomed to flashy displays, parades, coronations and other such celebrations are bound to find POR's ending a tad underwhelming. Lest there be any doubt, once Phlan is cleared of The Boss and his major minions, the City Clerk will hand over a pile of gems, some fairly hefty Experience bonuses, and tell you that you have completed The Quest.

** Realms of Darkness **

Light in the Realms

     Having polished off the first batch of quests in SSI's Realms of Darkness, your stalwart band is stymied. You know that a "Rogue Alliance" is stirring up trouble; but no one in Badel is handing out nice specific assignments. Then one day, in a desolate region just north of the city, your scout stumbles upon a hidden cave! Following a trail marked by flickering neon arrows you arrive at a brightly lit grotto in the center of which is a huge stone statue. At its feet a sign reads: "Ye Olde Computist's Oracle. Cross my palm with silver." Figuring that ANY chance to end your aimless wandering is worth taking, you plop the party's last silver denar into the figure's extended hand.

     With a horrendous groan the golem closes its fist upon the coin and begins to speak in a deep rumbling voice:

    "Questless in Badel? Not at all!
     To destroy the Rogue Alliance is the call.

     First, three quests for Shapes.
     Then, on the Star, a spell is bound;
     and teleport to another ground.

     One maze here? Yes, but toggles too.
     Enter a room past Gertrude's sign
     and map Level two a second time!

     Back to Badel, then North and down
     you pursue the Bones of Dragon.

     The Eight-legged Guardian passes just one.
     Pull, stone grinds, and the way is done.

     Rejoined and confused?
     A new doorway is used!

     Down a long corridor, past many alcoves you lead;
     and a mapper exclaims "Aha! 'Bones' indeed!"

     First, a hero's treasure;
     then East to take your magic's measure.

     Against a Rogues army second to none,
     Reflect early
     and Realms' greatest quest is won!"

** Spellbreaker **

Spellbreaker Break (Rating Change: **)

     Third in Infocom's legendary "Enchanter Trilogy", Spellbreaker (for 64K Apple II) casts you as the new leader of the Circle of Enchanters-- owing to your brilliancies in Enchanter and Sorcerer-- facing an ominous new threat to the very existence of magic. The all-text adventure easily earned three stars after my dad and I enjoyed many hours of challenging play.

     However, we had not finished the game and have, since, discovered a fairly significant bug! At some point in the adventure you will need an item (one of the cubes) obtained from a hermit at the cliff top. To get there you must stop an avalanche via the GIRCOL (time freeze) spell scroll. If you have used up the scroll to handle some earlier problem, you are likely to, eventually, find yourself 99% of the way through the adventure with no hope of winning!

     I finally checked the Clue Book-- something I have never before done for one of the "Enchanter" adventures. Its comment about wasting GIRCOL (on page 6) is: "Bad Move". No kidding! With luck, you may have to replay 'only' 80% of the game to correct the error you committed due to an ESP deficit.

     This sort of thing isn't supposed to happen in an Infocom product. If you need GIRCOL to solve the cliff puzzle, you should not be able to waste it somewhere else.

     Spellbreaker remains a fine adventure; and, now that the bug has been exposed, you can avoid the problem. Still, such flaws weaken the trust essential for enjoyment of puzzle-intensive adventuring. ("I've gotten this far. There MUST be a solution!")  Hence, the new (one star less) rating.

** Ultima V **

Wombala's Wonderful Walk

     Okay, so you've made it into the dungeon at the center of "Ultima V"'s Underworld only to encounter THE insoluble room. (i.e. You know there is an exit; but it's sealed or there's 'no way' to reach it). Not to worry. If you are on a IIGS with "Diversi Hack" or "Visit Monitor" installed, then Wombala's Wonderful Walk is at your disposal. Named for a sorcerer of the ancient Zulu empire, this realtime map-diddling spell replaces rocks, water, etc. with nice firm ground. When in the room, just do a CMD-CTRL-ESC, select Visit or Hack, go to the monitor and enter 800.878 (RETURN) to display the 121 bytes of the current 11x11 room map. $FF's are blanks, $4D's are rocks, etc.. Now type-in $05's wherever you want open ground; return to the game; and, ZAVOOMBA!, your Wonderful Walk is ready.

** Wizardry III **

Keeping the Wiz in Wiz III

    "THAT piece'", Gorbash commented, "has been invaluable."  The article to which he referred is John Wiegley's description of how to transfer characters from earlier Wizardrys to Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn

     Having 'gotten into' Sir Tech's new Trilogy package re-release (64K Apple II version), Gorbash had completed Knight of Diamonds only to encounter Wiz III's infamous 'spirit barrier'. Normally, developed characters do not truly transfer to Wiz III. Instead, your Legacy guys are supposed to be descendants of earlier heroes. Via a Rite of Passage they undergo a kind of 'spirit transfer' to acquire the "memories and skills" (and names) of Wiz I/II characters.

     Fair enough. It HAS been a long, long time since the legendary Knight of Diamonds quest. Alas, spirit transfer technology has a long way to go; The Rite slashes hard-won attributes and rips off possessions.

     JW's technique gets your guys into the Legacy scenario, too; but, in tact!  The first step is to go through the standard Wiz III character transfer to an initialized disk. (Do _not_, however, attempt the Rite of Passage.)  Using Copy II Plus's Sector Editor, the 'trick' is to find the last byte in each character's information block, add $20, and substitute the resulting value.

     The problem is that finding the last byte isn't always such a simple matter. Some blocks are split and the second part may not be in an adjacent sector.

     To simplify things, we finally went back to Wizardry II: Knight of Diamonds, rested-up/spelled-up the characters, and noted Level, Hit Points (current & max), plus any mage and priest spell counts (e.g. "9/9/9/9/9/7/5 ...") and current Armor Class. As shown in Rob Hall's "Wizardry" character block break-down (Computist #40, page 25-- another invaluable Wiz resource!), these numbers appear in the latter part of the block:

 Level at $84, $85
 Hit Points (current) at $86, $87
 Hit Points (max) at     $88, $89
 Mage spells (2-byte counts for each spell level 1-7)   at $92-$9F
 Priest spells (2-byte counts for each spell level 1-7) at $A0-$AD
 current Armor Class at  $B0, $B1


     After exiting Wiz II, we booted Copy II Plus, hopped to the Sector Editor, and used known character numbers (e.g. Level, etc.) to track down the second parts of split blocks. For example ...

Suppose Rev Gun's block shows up as starting at byte $B0 on the Sector Editor display for Track $1A, Sector $00. (You see "REV GUN" in flashing letters.)

Each "block" is $D0 bytes long; so, you know $50 bytes are here and the last $80 bytes of the block are somewhere else. If Rev Gun ended "Wiz' II'" with 283 Hit Points, then (if he left with current HP= max HP), you might SCAN for hex bytes 1B 01 1B 01 ($011B in hexadecimal = 283). Track $19, Sector $00 is a safe place to start, since character block storage seems to begin around Track $1A.

When Copy II Plus finds the numbers, you can use other character numbers to verify that, for sure, this is the rest of Rev Gun's block. Some 'good try' places to look for block continuations include Track/Sectors $1A/$0F, $1B/$00, $1B/$0B, $1B/$0C, $1B/0E.


     The creators of Wizardry III were concerned with the problem of designing a challenge appropriate for heroes which may come from either Wiz I or Wiz II. They have come up with a fairly plausible device for re-leveling the 'playing field'. The question is: just how much re-leveling are you willing to accept? Is the "legacy" of your new characters merely names and memories OR does it also include developed powers and a pile of hardware?!

** Wizardry V **

NOT a Bug

     Some years back, my dad caught what appeared to be a sure bug in the original "Ultima": when an attribute's value increments beyond 99, it resets to zero. Well, we called Richard Garriot/ Lord British and were told that the recyclying is, most certainly, not a bug. No indeed, Richard explained, it is a "feature" intended "to keep players from being too greedy".

     Evidently, there are many fewer bugs and many more features floating around than one might suppose. Last month I reported an apparent "Wizardry V" bug which produces unexpected Good-to-Evil shifts in orientation. Since the game does not permit forming a party including both Good and Evil members (though, interestingly, it will not boot out misfits at the time the shift occurs), the result can be the loss of valuable personnel. A problem? Yes. A bug? No. 

     According to Sir Tech's Brenda Garno, when the manual says: "Certain peaceful monster types may offer your party a truce" (p.58), it is referring to those times you encounter messages such as "You see a wandering group of Arch Devils  Attack/Leave alone". Choosing to attack is viewed as evidence of evil inclinations. (Like, clearly, you'd have to be really corrupt to beat-up on "peaceful" Arch Devils.)  Due to a random factor, just one such attack may trigger a shift; or, it may take several.


Wiz V: Kettles & False Mazes

     Dr. Hackenbush's question in #68 provoked a look through my "Wizardry V" notes, and, very probably, has re-hooked me on finishing the quest. This IS one of the great adventures.

     As to where to find the Laughing Kettle: on Level I at coordinates 22 East, 23 North, there is a secret door in the north wall which leads to the Kettle. He offers some useful clues for prices ranging from $500 through $5000. (Incidentally, don't be fooled by his jolly appearance. If attacked, the Kettle proves to be tough, powerful magic user; AND, should you win, the temple healers will require that you pay for his resurrection!)

     The "false mazes" encountered by some "Wiz' V" players ARE very strange places (places, in fact, where you are not supposed to be); but the phenomenon is not the result of some bug. (In the first batch of "Wizardry V" packages shipped, some did have bad diskettes-- quickly replaced by Sir Tech-- but, these simply crashed the game.)

     Rather, the false maze problem stems from player errors which go undetected because 'correct diskette' verification is limited, mainly, to occasions when you move from one level to another. For example, if you take an elevator to Level 3, the program will insist that Level 3's diskette be in place before play continues.

     If, once on Level 3, you should swap in Level 5's diskette, the program will try to construct a maze from (and do updates to!) whatever it finds. Naturally, the Level 5 'player copy' diskette is ruined; and you find yourself in an oddly 'inside-out' maze which can look just genuine enough to occupy your best mapping skills for an hour or so.

     My excursion into a false maze began when, using Roger Wagner's "Soft Switch" (on a IIgs), I decided to jump back to an earlier position on another level and forgot to swap in the new level's diskette. Well, the program had no way of knowing that some sly user was playing fast and loose with the adventure. It went merrily along, reading from and WRITING TO the other level's diskette; I ended up mapping a hefty chunk of "Wizardry V"'s 'twilight zone', and the diskette side was bombed.

     A reasonably satisfactory cure is to get out your set of originals and recopy the side that's been damaged. Everything on the restored level will be reset-- you may have to reopen a few locks, etc.-- but, at least, the quest can continue.

Hello adventurer, It is a bright sunny day in the farmlands of huscaloosia and you sit milking your cows and reflecting on how nice and boring your life is. You smile to yourself as you think about all the mundane tasks that await you in your coming day. Most people would bash their heads into the wall thinking about the meaninglessness your existence holds, but not you. You have always longed for a simple life, a warm fire, and a good harvest. OH SHIT, what's that?!?!?! A space meteor??? It's coming right at you! AHHHHH!!! *bang, boom, kersploosh*.... In an instant your farm is a pile of rubble and you lift yourself up from the ground, covered in dust and scrapes, That was close... You peak into the newly formed smouldering pit that is now full of your previous hopes, dreams, and cows remains to examine the wreckage.. WTF, thats not a meteor, it's a round metallic ball the size of volkswagen beetle and covered in glowing green runes!

"Yo!" you call out to the ball, for some reason expecting a response.

*rumble rumble rumble hum* The ball seems to respond as steam starts to release from the runes, which have since turned a sinister shade of magenta.

*CRACK* the ball splits into two like a ripe kielbasa inside you see a shitload of monsters!

I mean we are talking goblins, spiders, trolls, and oh shit is that a bandit in the back??

Where did this ball come from? Why is it in the middle of my farm? Why is that goblin giving me a dirty look?

These are all questions a smarter person would ask, instead you pick up a stick from amongst the rubble and get to crackin skulls........

..... To be continued........






Dude, like seriously, not cool! Your once idyllic farm is literally covered in the nasty entrails of your fallen foes. This place sucks now. No more grain, just stanky goblin bits and some unrecognizable pieces of that one bandit from earlier. Like that kind old ogre from that story your mum used to tell you about, your proverbial swamp has been taken over! Now, it's up to you to find some answers.

You get up to go to the village, taking only the clothes on your back and the loot you pillaged from those small goblin children you massacred, when you realize that blocking your path is a huge forrest! Oh shit, that's right! You were the idiot that chose to build his farm on the other side of the haunted woods from the village. Welp, hope you like that real spooky shit cause there are about to be some skeletons up in this bitch.

..... To be continued......




Why did I choose to live near a haunted woods? Who are all these ghosts and don't they have anything better to do than spread some frights? Like seriously, get a job ghosts! Anyway, you exit the forest and begin to walk into the outskirts of the village.. Ah home sweet village. Only, It isn't exactly as you remember it. Why is everybody wearing sunglasses? Why does that lady have unnecessary cogs stuck onto her blouse? Since when are top-hats back in style? Is this a new trend or the start of something sinister???

"Hey, where do you think you're going?" a voice from behind yells.

"Huh?" You say as you turn to face a nerdy looking dude and a clockwork dog hissing steam by his side.

"What a nerd..." you whisper under your breath as you ready your weapon, ready to do some nerd bashing.

........ To be continued.......



Whoops, turns out that there isn't a sinister steam-punk conspiracy going on in the village, only a super lame convention. Now you're wanted for murder. Good start, adventurer, way to go... I'm being sarcastic, you monster. No turning back now, you're officially on the run from the law. Too bad you can't stop in at one of the villages countless fortune-tellers or wise old shamans; they would have surely told you the haps. I guess it's up to you to figure out on your own now, using only your mental prowess and deductive abilities... There's absolutely no way that could go wrong!

As you've been standing there trying to rub two brain cells together to figure out your next move, the fantasy cops have been gaining on you, better get a move on! To your left you see the start of the great ronocian desert; there is no way they will follow you in there!

You start to run but barely make it 15 yards before you're attacked by a giant sand-crab! Plus you're kind of thirsty and you forgot your sun-screen... This trip's going to suck...

............ To be continued........




After like 30 minutes of wandering you have reached the other edge of the great ronocian desert. You also have a nasty-ass sunburn on the back of your neck.. Might want to get that checked out.

The desert now opens up to the great ronocian swamp (The cartographers were super lazy) and you start to roll up your pant legs to avoid getting that icky-sticky dirt water on your designer jeans. From the corner of your eye you see a metallic glint. It's one of the giant monster balls that crashed through your farm earlier! What the heck yo?! You scan your surroundings but see no signs of life.... 

"Hmmm, whats going on..?" You start to question as you feel something wrap around your muscular calf.

Ahhh!! A tentacle monster!! I've seen enough anime to know where this is going! better think fast adventurer!

........... To be continued.........




Yeah, let's never talk about that swamp again... Those tentacales, what happened under the water stays under the water...

We are back on solid land again and there is a chill in the air.



So, you're all set for The Great Underground Empire, eh?  Okay,
but before we begin, a few words about this walkthru.  First,
this is not the only way to solve the game.  It's just one of the
faster ones.  Second, because there is no "wasted motion" in this
game, you will not be visiting all the locations.  So, you might
want to play around with the game on your own for a while,
mapping out as much as you can, without much regard for gathering
treasures. Actually, mapping is a good idea, since, if you make a
misstep somewhere, you might find yourself in trouble!  Be
especially careful to follow the directions when in the mazes;  a
wrong move there, and you could be lost for quite some time!
Finally, you may not go through this in exactly the way it's
written because of the thief. He is a variable item in the game;
you never know where he will show up.  Try to move out of the
room he's in as soon as he shows up.  But keep in mind that even
if he does steal anything from you, you will get it all back from
him in the end. Okay?  Let's start the adventure! You begin West
of the house, and your first chore is to get inside.  So, go
South and East. Open the window and enter the house (you're in
the kitchen), then go West into the living room.  Get the lamp,
then move the rug, revealing the trap door.  Open the trap door,
turn on the lamp, and go down.  At this point, some mysterious
person will shut the door on you;  don't worry about that for
now. Okay, so here you are in the cellar.  It's time to pick up
your first treasure, so go South, then East to the Gallery. Get
the painting, then continue North to the Studio.  Go up the
chimney (you can only fit with the lamp and the painting), and
you will be in the kitchen again.  Now, go upstairs to the attic,
and get the knife and rope.  Come back down and go into the
living room. Open the case and put the painting inside.  Then,
drop the knife and get the sword.  Open the trap door again, and
return to the cellar.  Again, the door is shut by someone (you
never will find out who's doing this, but it doesn't matter).
Now you're back in the cellar, and since we're coming to one of
the more dangerous parts of the game, you might want to do a save
here. Gripping your trusty sword, head North into the Troll room.
There's a nasty troll here with a bloody axe, and the only way
past is to kill him.  So, do just that:  "Kill Troll With Sword."
It will most likely take more than one attempt, so keep at it,
and eventually he will disappear in a cloud of black smoke.  Now,
drop the sword, because you really don't need it any more, and it
will hinder you in carrying other, more important items.   Having
dispatched the troll, you move along East, East (into the Round
room), then SE and East. You are now in the Dome room. It's a
long way down, and too far to jump, so here's where the rope
comes in handy.  Tie the rope to the railing, then climb down the
rope.  You will be in the Torch room.  Leave the torch for now;
you'll be coming back this way again later. From the Torch room,
go South, then East and get the coffin. Return West, then
continue South to the Altar.  There's no way you're going to get
down that hole with the coffin, and even the program will tell
you that you haven't got a prayer. That's a hint, folks:  Just
"Pray," and you will find yourself in the forest again. Since
it's daylight out, save energy and turn off the lamp. Now, head
along South, then North (I know, but it works!) to the clearing,
then East to the Canyon View.  Climb all the way down to the
bottom, then go North to Rainbow's End.  Drop the coffin and open
it.  Inside is a jeweled sceptre.  Get that, and wave it.  The
rainbow will become solid (you'll need to cross over from the
other side later).  Now, "Look."  You should see a pot of gold.
Get that, and the coffin. After that, go SW, then all the way
back up to Canyon View. From there, it's NW to the clearing, and
then West to the window.  Once in the kitchen, open the bag and
get the garlic (nothing else, just the garlic). Go on into the
living room, and put your treasures in the case. Now, sit down
and take a breather, because you're about to do a lot of
traveling!

                 ZORK I Part Two

Once again, open the trap door, turn on the lamp, and go down.
Watch carefully, and you will notice that this time, the door
doesn't close!  Whoever was doing it before must have gotten
tired.  Anyway, you're on your way to the dam, so move along
North, East, North, NE, and East.  You are now on top of the dam.
From there, go North to the Lobby.  Pick up the matches, then go
either North or East (doesn't matter) into the Maintenance room.
Get the wrench and the screwdriver, then push the yellow button.
Now, return to the dam, and you will see that the green bubble is
lit.  Turn the bolt with the wrench, then drop the wrench. You
have opened the dam, and you will be coming back this way again
to reap the fruits of your labors.  However, right now, you're on
your way to Hades, so let's get going! Go South, then down into
the Loud room.  Leave the platinum bar for now;  you'll get it
later.  Head West into the Round room, then SE and East (hmmmm,
haven't you been here before?). Again, climb down the rope. This
time, get the torch.  At this point, you can turn off your lamp;
the torch will provide light so long as you have it. Now,
continue straight South, getting the bell, then the book and
candles from the altar.  Go down the hole to the cave, then down
again to the entrance to Hades.  Your candles will have blown out
by this time, but don't worry about it.  Okay, here's where you
have to be careful.  First, ring the bell. It will become red hot
and you will drop it.  You will also drop the candles.  Stay
calm, and do the following, all in one command:  Get the candles,
light match, light candles with match (necessary, because of the
torch, and *DON'T* use the torch, or you'll vaporize the
candles!).  Okay, strange things happened when you lit the
candles, now read the book. Whew!  The demons have been
exorcised! Drop the book, then go South and get the crystal
skull.  Now, back North, then up to the cave, then North to the
Mirror room. By the way, better put out the candles.  Rub the
mirror, and you will now be in another Mirror room (this one is
North of the dam, as the other one is South).   Now, go North,
then West, then North, then West into the Squeaky room (well, I
told you you'd be doing a lot of traveling this time!).  Make
sure you have the garlic with you, then go North into the Bat
room.  So long as you have the garlic, he won't bother you. There
is a jade figurine here, but leave it for now.  You'll pick it up
on your way out.

                  ZORK I Part Three

Go East to the Shaft room.  Put the torch into the basket, then
turn on your lamp and head North to the Smelly room, then down to
the Gas Room (best not to carry any open flames here!).  Now, you
are about to enter a small maze, so follow these directions
*CAREFULLY*! East, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, down, and you
should be at the top of the ladder (if you aren't, may God have
mercy on your soul!).  From there, go down to the Ladder Bottom,
and then South to the Dead End for the coal.  Get that, then
return to the ladder top.  From there, go up, North, East, South,
North, and you will be back in the Gas room.  Go up, then South
to the Shaft room again. Put the coal in the basket, and lower
the basket.  Now, guess what?  You have to go back through the
coal mine again! So, make your way to the Ladder Bottom, but this
time, go West to the Timber room.  Ignore the broken timber (not
useful for anything), and drop all but the screwdriver.  Now, you
can squeeze through the crack to the West. And here you are in
the Drafty Room, which is also at the bottom of the shaft.
There's the basket, so get the coal and the torch, and move South
into the Machine room.  Open the lid, put the coal in the
machine, close the lid, and turn the switch with the screwdriver.
Drop the screwdriver, open the lid, and get the diamond (well, no
one ever said Zork was an *EASY* game!). Now, go back North, and
put the torch and the diamond in the basket.  Squeeze back East
into the Timber room.  Get the skull, lamp, and garlic.  You
won't be needing the matches and the candles any more, so you can
leave them.  (They were insurance in case the thief came along
and stole the torch before you could get the diamond). Now, head
East again to the Ladder Bottom, and from there up and through
the coal mine (you know the way now!), to the Gas room.  Pick up
the bracelet, then continue on up and South to the Shaft room.
Get the torch and the diamond from the basket, turn off the lamp,
then go West into the Bat room.  Get the jade, then go South,
East, South to the Slide room.   Now, here's a fast way back to
the cellar:  Just go down the slide!  Wheeeee!  Then it's up to
the living room (remember, the trap door is open now), and all
the treasures go into the case.  Huff!  Puff!  Bet you didn't
know you'd be doing *THIS* much running around! But, don't get
too relaxed, there's still plenty more to come (urk!).

                  ZORK I Part Four

Turn on the lamp, and return to the cellar.  From there, it's
North (ah, deja vu!), then East, North, NE to Reservoir South.
Now that the sluice gates are open, you can head North, picking
up the trunk of jewels, North again to Reservoir North, getting
the air pump, and North one more time, getting the crystal
trident.  After that, go all the way back South again to
Reservoir South, then East to the dam, and then East once more to
the Dam Base. Here you find a little pile of folded plastic;
guess what it is?  Right, it's an inflatable boat!  So, inflate
it with the pump, then drop the pump, then get inside the boat,
say "Launch," and you're floating off along the Frigid River.
Now, just keep waiting until you see the buoy.  Get that, then
"East" to the beach.  Get out of the boat, then get the shovel
and move on to the Sandy Cave to the NE.  You might want to save
the game at this point, since you have to dig here until the
scarab turns up, and I'm sure you don't want to get buried alive
(it's been known to happen!).  Okay, drop the shovel and get the
scarab, then go back SW.  Drop the buoy and open it; inside is an
emerald.  Get that, then continue South to the Aragain Falls.
Here you can cross the rainbow (so do that!), which brings you to
the End of The Rainbow.  Turn off the lamp, then go SW to the
Canyon Bottom.  From there, make your way back to the living
room, and put all the treasures in the case.  Your collection is
quite impressive by now, but you aren't finished yet.  Go East
twice, then North twice.  Climb up the tree and get the egg.
Climb down again, and go South, East, and back to the living
room.  However, this time, you don't put the treasure in the
case. Turn on the lamp, and go down (once again!) into the
cellar, and North to the Troll room. Now, you are about to enter
a maze, so follow the directions very carefully! West (this
brings you into the maze), South, East, up, and you find several
items here.  Take only the coins and the key, and be careful not
to touch the skeleton!  From here, go SW, East, South, SE, and
you will be in the Cyclops room.  The Cyclops is not friendly,
but you can deal with him effortlessly: Just type in "Ulysses"
(or "Odysseus," if you prefer). Old One-Eye will tear out of
there right through the wall! In fact, he will create a passage
eastward from that room right into the living room! However, you
don't want to go that way yet!  Instead, go upstairs, and you
will be in the Treasure Room, the thief's secret lair.  Now, give
him the egg, and go back downstairs, then East to the living
room. Deposit the coins in the case, then get the knife (the
thief needs a little time to open the egg).  Okay, go back West
to the Cyclops room.  Again, at this point, saving is
recommended; the thief will not be easy to kill! So, head
upstairs and use the nasty knife to kill the thief. Once he's
dead, all treasures in the room will be visible.  This includes
the egg, a silver chalice, and anything he may have stolen from
you before. Get everything, then follow these directions:  Down,
NW, South, West, up, down, NE, and you will be in the Grating
Room. Unlock and open the grate (watch out for falling leaves!),
then go up.  You will be in a clearing. From there, go South and
climb the tree again.  Wind up the canary that's inside the egg.
A songbird will come by and drop a bauble for you.  Climb down
again and get the bauble, then return to the living room.  Put
all the treasures in the case, making sure you *REMOVE THE
CANARY* from the egg and put it in the case separately!  You're
almost finished!  Just one more trip to make! Now, for the last
time, enter the cellar and go North.  From the Troll Room, go
East until you come again to the Loud Room. Type in:  "Echo," and
you will now be able to get the bar.  So, grab it and return to
the living room.  Once you place it in the case, you will get a
message. Follow the advice of that message, and you will get a
map. Take that, and return to the place where this all started,
the mailbox West of the house. You should have no trouble getting
to the barrow from there.  Of course, once you enter the
barrow.... You didn't really think it would end there, did you?
Not when there's still Zork II and Zork III waiting for you up
ahead! Ah, but it's too late;  you can't turn back now!  You'll
just have to grit your teeth and follow through to the end (with
a little help, of course).  See you in Zork II!



You start off in front of the house.  Don't go in just yet.  N.  N (Forest
Path).  U.  GET EGG.  Here's the first of your adventure-killing pitfalls,
i.e., dropping the egg while you're in the tree.  *Don't*!  D.  S.  E (Behind
House).  OPEN WINDOW.  W.  OPEN SACK.  Neither the water nor the lunch serve
any purpose, but you will need the garlic later.  Leave it for now.  W.  OPEN
CASE.  Hold onto the egg; you have to find a way to open it (safely!) first.
GET ALL.  MOVE RUG.  Ah, here's your ticket to the GUE.  OPEN TRAPDOOR.  D.  No
turning back now!  And your adventure begins in earnest...TURN ON LANTERN.  S.
E.  GET PAINTING.  The chimney leads to the kitchen, but you can only go up
with a very light load, far less than what you're carrying right now, so forget
it.  W.  N.  Save your game and go N to the Troll Room.  A vicious troll lurks
here and he'll probably attack you the moment you enter.  Respond in kind:
ATTACK TROLL WITH SWORD.  Repeat until he's dead.  He's a clumsy fighter, so
you should easily dispatch him without taking any damage.  If not, restore your
game and try again.  DIAGNOSE after the battle if you're uncertain.  You'll
want all your strength for your next (and last) fight, which will come up
shortly.  DROP SWORD.  You don't need it anymore, and you can disregard the
troll's ax as well.  W.  Hoo boy, a maze, what a delight.  You *did* remember
to save after beating the troll, right?  Incidentally, the thief will probably
show up for the first time while you're in the maze.  Don't worry if he robs
you; in fact, that's exactly what you want.  If he sizes you up, GIVE
EGG...that's right, let him have it...and leave the area posthaste.  If he
doesn't show up, restore and go through the maze again, or just wait until he
appears.  Okay, you're at the start of the maze.  S.  E.  U.  You find the
remains of an adventurer who foolishly tried to navigate the maze without a
walkthrough...and what do you know, he's got stuff on him.  GET COINS.  The key
unlocks a grate in the forest, but it just leads back to the maze, so ignore
it.  Best leave the skeleton and knife alone, too.  SW.  E.  S.  SE.  Out of
the fryer and into the broiler; a cyclops bars your way, he's as indestructible
as the cavern walls, and worse, he looks a little hungry.  Stay calm...SAY
"ULYSSES".  The monster will tear out of the room, opening up a path back
to...the Living Room!  Much better than that musty 'ol chimney, eh?  E.  E.
PUT TREASURES IN CASE if you still have any.  E.  U.  The attic is dark, which
is why you need to keep the lantern on.  (Yes, you can get eaten in the attic!
Man, those grues are ruthless...) GET ALL.  D.  W.  W.  W.  Save, take a deep
breath, and take the ladder up.  You're in the thief's Treasure Room, where he
puts all the treasures that he steals from you, and he's none too pleased about
you finding it.  ATTACK THIEF WITH KNIFE and repeat.  The thief is *far*
deadlier than the troll, and there's a very good chance that you'll get killed.
 If so, restore and retry.  Don't try to take him on with any other weapon; the
sword is practically useless (you keep hitting him with the flat of the blade
for some reason), the axe is slow and ineffective, and the dead adventurer's
knife is cursed and will kill YOU if you use it!  Anyway, once you finally
dispatch the scoundrel, save.  You can now take all the treasures in the room,
including the thief's own silver chalice.  And guess what, when he opened the
egg, he found another treasure inside!  You have no more need for weaponry, so
DROP KNIFE.  GET ALL TREASURES.  D.  E.  E.  TURN OFF LANTERN.  PUT ALL
TREASURES IN CASE.  If you're badly wounded (DIAGNOSE if you're curious,
although you don't really need to since you won't take any more damage for the
rest of the game), you'll have to make another trip to get everything.  This is
no big deal.  GET CANARY.  This takes it out of the egg.  E.  E.  N.  N (Forest
Path).  WIND CANARY.  The songbird appears, responds to the canary's song, and
in the process drops a brass bauble.  Three treasures from one, amazing...GET
BAUBLE.  Return to the Kitchen.  GET GARLIC.  W.  PUT CANARY AND BAUBLE IN
CASE.  Six down, thirteen to go!  OPEN TRAPDOOR.  D.  You'll notice that the
trapdoor doesn't close this time.  Apparently, whoever closed the door wanted
to give you the feeling that you were trapped, thus creating tension.  But now
that you've opened up a different way out, there's no longer any fear of
entrapment, so barring the trapdoor has lost its purpose.  Or something.  TURN
ON LANTERN.  N.  E.  N.  NE (Reservoir South).  E.  You're now at the Flood
Control Dam #3, which created the huge reservoir you just passed.  N.  GET
MATCHES.  N or E (it doesn't matter).  Here we have the Zork trilogy's first
"lady or tiger" quandary in the form of the colored buttons.  Okay, the yellow
button is the one you're after.  The red button just turns the lights on, while
the brown button reverses what the yellow button does (and is thus useless).
Avoid the blue button at all costs.  PUSH YELLOW.  GET ALL EXCEPT TUBE.  You
get the tools, and the chests simply fall apart.  The Tube 'o Gunk is useless.
S or W.  S.  S.  Hmm, what does a green light mean?  TURN BOLT WITH WRENCH.
DROP WRENCH.  W.  The reservoir is now draining rapidly and will be crossable
when you come by here again.  SW.  S.  S (Round Room).  SE.  E (Dome Room).  It
looks like a dead end.  And isn't, of course.  TIE ROPE TO RAILING.  D.  You
wind up on a tall pedestal in the middle of a room, atop which rests a new
light source.  TURN OFF LANTERN.  GET TORCH.  The torch's light is endless, and
as long as you have it you can leave the lantern off (hang onto it, though;
you'll need it later).  The torch is also a treasure, by the way, which is why
it's a good thing you already killed the thief.  D.  GET BELL.  S (Altar).  GET
ALL.  Before going further, check your inventory and make sure you have all of
the following: candles, book, bell, torch, screwdriver, matches, garlic,
lantern.  This is the maximum number of items you can carry, by the way, so if
you can't pick up something make sure you're not carrying anything extra.  (By
now any damage done by the thief should have healed, so you can carry a full
load.) *Save*, go D, and go D again to the entrance to the Land of the Dead.
You have to exorcize the spirits to gain passage.  Do the following in
succession: RING BELL, GET CANDLES, LIGHT MATCH, LIGHT CANDLES, READ BOOK.
Don't dally or the exorcism will fail.  Once the spirits disperse, DROP CANDLES
AND MATCHES AND BOOK, then go S to the Land of the Dead.  Here's a nice reward
for your efforts!  GET SKULL.  Note: You have a limited time from when you
first enter the Altar room to perform the exorcism.  If you wait too long, the
candles will burn down too far to light, and you're sunk.  Also, if you don't
take the candles, they'll burn down *even if you blow them out*!  Incredible
but true.  Taking the candles and blowing them out *might* prevent them from
burning down, but there's really no point in doing this when you already have
two light sources.  It's best to just do the exorcism right away and get it
over with.  There's nothing else to do in the Land of the Dead, so leave.  N.
U.  You can't go back, so you may as well go forward.  N.  Like the Dome Room,
this only looks like a dead end.  TOUCH MIRROR.  Although it appears that
nothing's happened, you've actually been transported to an identical-looking
room (this one's north of the reservoir; the other's south of it).  N.  Eureka,
a new area (an old coal mine, to be exact) W.  The slide is your ticket out of
here; leave it for now.  N.  W.  N.  There's a bat guarding this room, which
will immediately pick you up and drop you someplace far away...unless you have
garlic.  Which you do, of course.  DROP GARLIC.  As long as the garlic is in
this room, the bat will stay put.  GET FIGURINE.  E (Shaft Room).  PUT TORCH
AND SCREWDRIVER IN BASKET.  You're about to enter a room containing a lot of
coal gas, and if you're carrying anything with open flames, you'll get blown to
bits.  N.  TURN ON LANTERN.  D (Gas Room).  GET BRACELET.  Save before going E.
 You're now in a "non-descript part of a coal mine"...yep, you guessed it,
another maze!  NE.  SE.  SW.  D.  You should be at the Ladder Top.  If
not...well, you know what to do.  D.  S.  GET COAL.  N.  U.  You have to get
back to the Gas Room now, and the path is *not* the same as the one you
originally took!  "Standard level" my eye...N.  E.  S.  N.  Gas Room, yay.  U.
S.  PUT COAL IN BASKET.  LOWER BASKET.  As you've probably guessed by now, that
shaft leads somewhere important, and now you're going to go there.  Go all the
way back to the Ladder Bottom, then W.  DROP ALL.  You must be completely
unburdened to fit through the passageway.  Oh, and *don't* turn off the
lantern!  W.  You're now at the bottom of the shaft...which is dark, which is
the other reason you had to put the torch in the basket.  GET TORCH AND COAL
AND SCREWDRIVER (GET ALL doesn't work because they're inside another object).
S.  Bet you were wondering why you made that extra trip just to put the coal in
the basket.  OPEN LID.  PUT COAL IN MACHINE.  CLOSE LID.  TURN SWITCH WITH
SCREWDRIVER.  OPEN LID.  GET DIAMOND.  A lot of work, but the payoff was worth
it, no?  DROP SCREWDRIVER.  N.  PUT DIAMOND AND TORCH IN BASKET.  RAISE BASKET.
 E.  GET ALL EXCEPT TIMBER (it's useless).  Return to the Gas Room for the last
time.  U.  S.  GET DIAMOND AND TORCH.  DROP LANTERN.  With the thief dead and
the Gas Room no longer a threat, you can use the torch without fear for the
rest of the game.  W.  S.  E.  S (Slide Room).  D.  Remember that ramp you saw
in the Cellar?  Well, guess where you are now.  U.  PUT ALL TREASURES EXCEPT
TORCH IN CASE.  Wonderful, you're halfway there and you've already done all the
hard stuff.  It's nothing but smooth sailing the rest of the way.  D.  N.  E.
E (Round Room).  E.  This is the Loud Room, which is pretty weird; anything you
enter (including LOOK or INVENTORY) will do nothing but cause an echo.  That
should be a hint...SAY "ECHO".  The room will quiet down, and the platinum bar
is now free for the taking.  GET BAR.  W.  W.  N.  NE.  Back to the reservoir,
which is now drained.  N.  So there *was* something hidden under all that
water!  GET TRUNK.  N.  N.  GET TRIDENT.  You've just hit your weight limit, so
leave the air pump for now.  S.  S.  S.  SW.  SW (East/West Passage) and back
to the Living Room.  PUT ALL TREASURES EXCEPT TORCH IN CASE.  Time now for a
return trip to the Temple.  D.  N.  E.  E.  SE.  E.  D.  D.  This time go E to
the Egyptian Room.  GET COFFIN.  OPEN COFFIN.  GET SCEPTRE.  Now, instead of
trudging all the way back to the Living Room, go W and S to the Altar and PRAY.
 This instantly zips you to a clearing in the forest!  Which happens to be near
where you want to go next.  E.  E.  S.  E (Top of Canyon).  D.  D.  N (End of
Rainbow).  WAVE SCEPTRE.  Hot dang, one becomes three again!  GET POT.  You've
also turned the rainbow into a bridge, which you'll need pretty soon.  You're
weighed down again, so it's time for another return trip.  SW.  U.  U (Top of
Canyon).  W.  W.  E to the now-familiar Forest Path, and back to the Living
Room.  It's very easy to get lost in the forest, which is why you should follow
these steps exactly.  Thankfully, there are no dangers here, so if you do get
lost, just keep wandering until you find a familiar landmark.  Again, PUT ALL
TREASURES EXCEPT TORCH IN CASE.  Almost done!  Return to Reservoir South (you
know the way by now!).  N.  N.  GET PUMP.  S.  S.  E.  D.  Leave the "folded
pile of plastic" where it is and INFLATE PLASTIC WITH PUMP.  Not surprisingly,
it's a boat.  DROP PUMP (or not...it really doesn't matter at this point in the
game).  ENTER BOAT.  LAUNCH.  Kick back, relax, and wait for the current carry
you downstream.  Ignore the first landing; it just leads back to the Loud Room.
 Keep waiting until the buoy shows up, then take it.  OPEN BUOY.  Looks like it
wasn't just a warning marker after all.  Assume nothing in the GUE!  By now
you're at the last landing area, and the water's become very treacherous.  LAND
or E.  You can also land at the second landing area (to the east) before
opening the buoy, but you *must* land by the third landing area or you'll
plummet over a waterfall to your death.  GET OUT.  GET EMERALD.  DROP BUOY.  If
you're at the third landing area, go N to the second landing.  GET SHOVEL.  NE.
 DIG SAND WITH SHOVEL four times to find the buried scarab.  GET SCARAB.  SW.
DROP SHOVEL.  S.  S (Aragain Falls).  Go W twice, crossing the rainbow bridge
to the End of Rainbow, and go all the way back to the Living Room.  PUT ALL
TREASURES IN CASE.  What's this, counsel from a benevolent deity?  Or maybe the
mysterious person who locked the trapdoor?  Whoever it's from, follow it.  L.
Hey, that parchment wasn't there before!  L AT MAP.  Southwest, huh?  Return to
the west of the house, the place where...yes...it all began.  And there it is.
SW.  Save your game if you like, then go W into the barrow.

Well done, Master Adventurer!  You've slain the villainous thief, uncovered
numerous long-forgotten secrets, and recovered all the treasures of the first
part of the GUE.  But your journey has just begun, and a whole new set of
tricks and twists, as well as a new enemy, lie ahead.





Once you begin, you can open the mailbox and read the leaflet if you want, but
it is by no means required. (It is also fun to throw the leaflet at yourself.)
Anyways, head north from the house twice and go up the tree there.

At the top, in the bird's next, should be an ornate, jeweled egg. Bet that hurt
coming out.  :P  Anyways, take it. Don't worry about opening it - while you can
do so (just throw the egg while up here), it will damage the contents within,
so forget about. We'll get someone else to open it.

Go on down and south, then east. You should have a window near you on the
house; open it and enter the house. Take the bottle and go west. Open the case
there and take the sword and the lantern, which will become quite familiar to
you as you continue throughout this and other Zork games.

Next, go east and up the stairs to the attack. Turn on the lantern and take the
rope. Turn off the lantern (it will eventually run out if left on, and we need
it a lot in this game), then go back downstairs. Go west and move the rug in
the living room.

Open the trap door and go on down. As luck would have it, the door closes above
you, preventing the need for you to do so yourself. ... Oh, wait.



Trollz!:
````````

Here, turn the lantern on, lest a wandering grue devour you. (What the heck is
a grue, anyways?) Then take note of how your sword is somewhat glowing - it
glows like this with an enemy is in an adjacent room, and grows brightly when
they are in the same room as yourself.

Thusly, opt to "save" the game. That way, if you get your head chopped off or
something, you can "restore" the game back to this point. Afterwards, go north
and you'll find the troll. Pretty much just fight the troll with your sword -
it may take more than one hit, but keep going until  *someone*  bites the dust.

After the fight, "diagnose" your condition. If you're able to be killed with a
light wound, I'd use the "wait" command until my wounds healed up a bit, as we
will be fighting some enemies soon enough, but they generally won't seriously
wound you.



The Underground Maze:
`````````````````````

After defeat the troll, go west. You'll find this area to be one of the most
baffling you'll ever encounter as, if you go one way, you generally cannot
trace your steps back.  O_o  It would be prudent to follow my directions to
the letter.

Also, during the course of the maze, you may meet up with some kind of man, who
may steal from you. You don't particularly want this, so save before going any
further. He can also attack you. You will want to check your inventory (just
use "inventory") after the encounters. If you have a sword, lantern, bottle,
and coins (if you're that far), then there's no real need to worry about
restoring, since you want him to take the jeweled egg. Otherwise, restore.
(If you don't get him to steal it, don't worry.)

Anyways, once in the maze, go south, east, and up. Don't mess with the
skeleton here or you'll lose everything, and that is not good. Take just the
bag of coins, then go southwest, east, south, and southeast to the Cyclops's
room.

What do you do about him? Well, anyone remember Greek mythology? Basically,
just input the command "Say 'Ulysses'" and the Cyclops will run off, leaving
a metaphorical trail of urine behind him.



The Land of the Living Dead:
````````````````````````````

Did the thief take the egg from you? If not, save in the Cyclops room and go
up. You'll find the thief's hideout; he may wound you, but it is very unlikely
to be serious. Give the egg to the thief and go back down. We'll kill him
later, don't worry.  >:)

Then go southeast, east, and east. Hey, this area's familiar. Put the treasures
into the case, open the trap door, and go down. Head north, east, north,
northeast, and east. Go north into the dam lobby and take the matchbook. Go
south twice to the Deep Canyon and go down.

Then go west, southeast, and east to the Dome Room. Save and jump for a bit of
fun, but it is counterintuitive (you lose items, even if you go where you need
to). After that, tie the rope to the railing and head down to the Torch Room.

Go south and take the bell, then south again. Take the book and the candles.
Also consider reading the book, though it isn't required. Go down from here
and repeat this action.

Welcome to Hell! That is to say, the Entrance to Hades. So, Greek Hell. Now,
then, let us exorcise the crap out of those devilish spirits...

Open the matchbook, then ring the bell to stop the spirits. This will cause
you to drop the candles; don't worry. Light a match, then light the candles
with this match. Wave the candles and you'll scare the living crap out of
those spirits. Read the book (again, possibly) to get rid of them. Nice.

Pour some water on the bell, then take the bell - it grew hot and you dropped
it, too, remember? Put out the candles as well, then drop the bottle. Go south
you'll find an ornate skull. Take it.



The Thief:
``````````

After taking the skull, go north, up, north, north, north, west, west, south,
south, and east. Take the painting here and go west, north, and up. Hey, I
know this place! Put the painting into the case to lighten your load.

Take the bag of coins and go west, then west again to the Cyclops room. Save
here and we can deal with the thief. There are two big methods as to how to do
so.

The main one is the most obvious. Go up and restore the game until you end up
not getting hit upon entrance. Then give the coins to the thief, then "Kill
thief with sword". You may get a hit on him; you need to give him a light wound
at least. Otherwise, restore. Then repeat this, but hand over the skull first.
Then just keep bashing at him. You might get lucky.

The second one is a lot easier. Go up and "Get stiletto". You'll likely fail;
don't worry. Go back down and use the "G" command. Due to some bad programming,
you'll then actually receive the stiletto. Go upstairs and repeatedly try to
kill the thief with the stiletto. Lot easier, ain't it? As with the previous
method, you can give the thief the coins/skull to distract him as needed.

Once you win the battle, take all of the treasures. (Let your wounds heal if
needed.) Then go down, east, and east. Put all of the treasures into the case.
Go west, west, and up, take the stiletto (if you need to), then go down, east,
and east. (If you already had the stiletto, for whatever reason, ignore this
last bit.)



Draining the Reservoir:
```````````````````````

After the above, save. Take the clockwork canary (it is what was in the jeweled
egg), then go east, east, north, north, and up. Wind the canary. Huh.

Go down and take the brass bauble, and go south, east, west, west, and put all
of the treasures into the case. Save if you want.

Now, onto the actual business. Go down, north, east, north, northeast, and east
to find the controls for the dam. We'll mess with it later - go north and north
again. Switch off the lantern and press the red button. Only take the
screwdriver, then push the yellow button. Go south two times and turn the bolt
with the wrench.

Wait a few times and the reservoir will soon drain. Go west and turn on the
lantern, then north. Drop all but the lantern and go north twice. Take the
trident - you know who that's a reference to, right? - and go south twice. Take
the trunk and go south, southwest, southwest, west, south, and up. Put all of
the treasures in the case.



Coal and Diamonds:
``````````````````

Go east and open the sack there. Take the garlic - as if you'd eat it! - and go
west, down, north, east, north, northeast, and north. Take all the crap you
dropped before. Go north twice.

Then go up, north, north, west, north, west, and north. Get the figurine and go
east. Put the screwdriver, matchbook, and candles into the basket; we'll do
more with this later.

Go north, down, and take the bracelet. Then go east, northeast, southeast,
southwest, down, down, and west. Drop all but the lantern here and go east,
south, take the coal, north, up, up, north, east, south, north, up, and
south. Phew!

Take the candles and the matchbook. Light a match and then light the candle
with it. Put the candles and coal into the basket, then lower it. Go north,
down, east, northeast, southeast, southwest, down, down, and west.

Drop all of your stuff and go west. Hey, look! It's the basket! Take the
candles, screwdriver, and the coal. Head south and open the lid. Put the coal
into this machine and close the lid. Move the switch with the screwdriver, then
open the lid for a big freakin' diamond! Take it and go north.

Put the candles, diamond, and screwdriver into the basket. Go east and take
everything except the stiletto and timber, then go east, up, up, north, east,
south, north, up, and south. Raise the basket and take the candles and the
diamond.

May as well return to the treasure case. Go west, south, east, south, down, and
up. Put all treasures into the case.



Silence is Golden:
``````````````````

Go down, north, east, east, north, northeast, east, south, and down.

Whatever logic it seems to defy, say "Echo", and, for some random reason, the
room becomes quiet. Huh. That was easy. Take the platinum bar and go southeast,
east, and down. Turn off the lantern, then drop the lantern and the candles.
Take the torch now, which will eternally be lit.

Go south and east. Open the coffin and take the sceptre. Go west, south, down,
north, north, north, west, west, south, and up. Put all of the treasures
EXCEPT the sceptre and torch into the case. We still got stuff to do with them
pretty soon.

Go east four times, down twice, and north. You'll find the rainbow, but no
random leprechaun, north a pot of gold. Perhaps on the other side? Wave the
sceptre so we can see. Yup, that worked - take the pot of gold.

Then head east twice, north twice, and take the shovel. Go northeast and
dig in the sand with the shovel. You'll eventually, after a few repetitions of
this action, find a scarab. After this, drop the shovel, as you will no longer
need to use it. Take the scarab and go southwest, south twice, west, twice,
southwest, up twice, northwest, and west thrice. Put all treasures EXCEPT the
torch into the case.


Row, Row, Row Your Boat...:
```````````````````````````

Go down, north, east thrice, up, northwest, and north twice. Take the air pump,
as you'll obviously need it later. Go south twice, east, down, and take the
plastic. This pile of random plastic actually is an air boat. We'll use it
momentarily.

Go up, south, down, and east twice. Drop all but the pump and torch, then
"inflate plastic". Then get into the boat and launch it. Wait around for a bit
until you read something about a red buoy. Take it and land to the east.

Here, open the buoy to find an emerald. Weird place to keep treasure, but I've
seen weirder, I guess. Drop the buoy, get out of the boat, deflate the boat,
and get the plastic. Go south until you reach Aragain Falls. (Note: Niagara.)

There, go west twice, southwest, up twice, northwest, and west four times. Put
the emerald into the case, then go down, north, and east five times. Take all
but the label. (It won't be there if you read it, which is just as okay.)



Continued in Zork II...:
````````````````````````

Oh, heck no, I ain't letting you off that easily.  :P   We'll actually finish
this journey.

Go west three times, southeast, east, down, south, and east. Take the coffin -
if needed, drop all but the torch. Go west and south. Pray to find yourself
in the forest.  O_o  Now head east, south, east, and west twice. Put all of the
treasures into the case.

Read the parchment you caused to fall. Interesting... Go east twice, southwest,
northwest, and southwest. Go into the tomb and...

Huh. My game closed off. Well, given that Zork II starts in the Stone Barrow,
it is quite likely that this is the end of the game.
